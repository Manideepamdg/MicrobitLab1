# MicrobitLab1
Microbit programming with python. Kodoteket, Ã„lmhult.
# NOTE: You CANNOT program this code without a BBC microbit version 1
# NOTE: Please make sure that you put tabs after every line dependin on what line you are writing
I have written the code in the format it has to be written, so when you are copying it to the python editor, please use my format.

# How to make a random name picker ?
We will write some names in the code and then, the code will transmit it to the microbit and display a random name on it.

# How to connect the microbit to your device ?
Use a USB cable and plug the little end to the mcrobit. Use the other side to plug it into your device.

# What do you do when you are done ?
When you are done writing the code, click the download button on the top left corner of the tab.
Next, you will get a pop up on the bottom of your screen, press the arrow to open a little box whic will include "Open file location"
Grab the file and drop it to the microbit file.



Then wait to see the magic happen on the microbit.
If it says syntax error on line "3" for example, please check you code again.
